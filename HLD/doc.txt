1: Vertical scaling (also called scaling up) means increasing the capacity of a single server to handle more load.
    a: Load Balancing not required because because we have only 1 server.
    b: Single poing of failure.
    c: It is fast because here it has inter process communication within the server only.
    d: Data will be consistent because we have only 1 server so we can lock data base do changes so data will be consistent.
    e: There is limitation in hardware because how much bigger server you can take number of CPU core has limitation, Ram Storage has limitation, ssd/hdd storage has limitations.
    f: Maintaince is simple as we have only 1 server. 

2: Horizontal scaling (also called scaling out) means increasing the capacity of your system by adding more servers, instead of upgrading a single one.
    a: Load balancer is required as we have to select from which server we want to connect.
    b: We have multiple system so it is resilient and will not have single point of failure as other systems can work as a backup
    c: It is slow as compare to vertical scalling as there is a network calls between the servers for communication called (Remote Procedural Calls).
    d: Data inconsistency can be a problem because if you are doing any atomic transaction then locking all the servers is not possible and data might get inconsistent while doing transactions.
    e: There is no hardware limitation you can increase servers as required.
    f: Maintaince is costly as multiple servers required maintainance.

3: Webpage is a collection of data stored in html file in html format which can be represented using any browser.

4: A server is a specialized computer or software system that provides resources, services, or data to other computers—called clients—over a network.
    It receives requests from clients, processes them, and sends back the appropriate response. 

5: An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol. It works like a digital address that allows devices to locate, identify, and communicate with each other over the internet.

6: Advantages of NoSQL over SQL: 
    a: Insertion and Retrievals are less expensive as compare to SQL. Let say you have table student and columns address which has a separate table then while fetching data we have to use join b/w student and address table but in NoSql all data are stored in one place.
    b: Any changes in schema can be done easly just start adding new field in NoSql.
    c: Build for scaling 
    d: Built for metrics/ analytics/ aggregation

7: Disadvantages of NoSql over SQL:
    a: Data consistency is problem. (ACID) properties are not supported.
    b: Read time for particular column for slower than SQL.
