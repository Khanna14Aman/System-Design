1: What are Functional Requirements?
    Functional requirements define the specific features and operations a system must perform to meet business and user needs. They describe what the system should do and how it should interact with users or other systems.

    Focus on system behavior and functionality.
    Represent the features that can be directly observed and tested in the final product.
    Common examples include user authentication, data processing, search, payment handling, and report generation.


2: What are Non-Functional Requirements?
    Non-functional requirements (NFRs) define how a system should operate, focusing on performance, reliability, and user experience rather than specific features. They ensure the system is efficient, secure, and maintainable over time.

    Performance – speed and responsiveness
    Security – protection against unauthorized access
    Usability – ease of use
    Reliability – system stability and availability
    Scalability – ability to handle growth
    Maintainability – ease of updates and fixes
    Portability – ability to run in different environments


3: User Perspective
    Functional requirements are directly visible to users and tied to business needs.
    Non-functional requirements shape the user experience by ensuring efficiency, reliability, and smooth operation.

4: Evaluation
    Functional requirements are validated through functional testing (unit, integration, or acceptance tests).
    Non-functional requirements are verified via performance, security, and usability testing.
