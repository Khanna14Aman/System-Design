1: High-level design or HLD is an initial step in the development of applications where the overall structure of a system is planned.
    Focuses mainly on how different components of the system work together without getting to know about internal coding and implementation.

2: System Architecture: System architecture is an overview of the entire system that represents the structure and the relationships between various components. It helps to visually represent how different parts interact and function.
3: Modules and Components: High-level design breaks down the systems into modules or components, each with specific roles and responsibilities, and has a distinct function that contributes to the entire system, helping in developing an efficient system.
4: Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs): Data Flow Diagrams demonstrate the data movement within the system. They help to understand how information is processed and pass from one end to another.
5: Interface Design: It includes the design of application programming interfaces (APIs) for system integration and user interfaces (UIs) for user interaction, ensuring seamless functionality and communication between components.
6: Technology Stack: The technology stack is various technologies and tools that will be used in the development of the system. This includes programming languages, frameworks, and databases.
7: Deployment Architecture: It includes how the system will be hosted and accessed. It includes server configurations, cloud    infrastructure, and network considerations.
